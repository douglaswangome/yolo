### hosts

```
# This is an example Ansible inventory file.
# The hosts below are grouped under the 'all' group,
# which is the default group for all hosts in the inventory.

[all]
ansible_host=127.0.0.1 # This host is the local machine.
port=2222 # This is the SSH port for the local machine.
```

### ansible.cfg

```cfg
# This is the main Ansible configuration file.
# It defines global settings for all Ansible runs.

[defaults]
# This specifies the inventory file to use for your hosts.
# It tells Ansible where to find the list of managed nodes.
inventory = hosts

# This is the default user that Ansible will use to connect to remote hosts.
remote_user = vagrant

# This is the path to the SSH private key used for authentication.
# This key is typically generated by Vagrant for its virtual machines.
private_key_file = .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key

# This specifies the directory where Ansible will look for roles.
roles_path = ./ansible/roles

# This setting disables host key checking for new connections.
# It's useful for development environments like Vagrant, but
# it's recommended to enable this for production environments.
host_key_checking = False
```

## Roles

This project uses Ansible to automate the deployment of a full-stack application.

### Folder and File Structure Explanation

- **`ansible/`**: This directory contains all the Ansible-related files, including roles.
  - **`roles/`**: This directory holds reusable Ansible roles. Each role is a self-contained unit of automation that is included in a playbook.
    - **`backend_deployment/`**: This role is responsible for deploying the application's backend.
    - **`clone_repo/`**: This role handles cloning the application's source code from a version control repository onto the target server.
    - **`frontend_deployment/`**: This role is dedicated to deploying the application's frontend.
    - **`install_docker/`**: This role installs and configures Docker on the target hosts.
    - **`install_git/`**: This role installs the Git version control system on the target hosts. It's a prerequisite for the `clone_repo` role.
    - **`network_deployment/`**: This role manages network-related docker configurations.
- **`backend/`**: This folder contains the source code for the application's backend.
- **`client/`**: This folder contains the source code for the application's frontend.
- **`.gitignore`**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It helps keep the repository clean by excluding build artifacts, sensitive information, and editor-specific files.
- **`ansible.cfg`**: This is the global configuration file for Ansible. It defines various settings like the inventory file location, the default remote user, and SSH settings.
- **`docker-compose.yaml`**: This file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It specifies the services, networks, and volumes for the application, making it easy to deploy the entire stack with a single command.
- **`EXPLANATION.md`**:
- **`hosts`**: This is the Ansible inventory file. It lists the managed nodes and organizes them into groups. This is where you define the target machines for your Ansible playbook.
- **`image.png`**:
- **`playbook.yaml`**: This is the main Ansible playbook. It orchestrates the entire deployment process by calling the roles in a specific order to build and deploy the application.
- **`README.md`**:
- **`Vagrantfile`**: This file is used by Vagrant to define and configure virtual machines. It specifies the base box, network settings, and provisioners to create a consistent, reproducible development environment.
